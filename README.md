# LavaWorkshop
_A fork of LavaworkSpace by InfinateXtremer_

## Introduction
This framework is a fork of the original LavaWorkspace that was created by InfinateXtremer. LavaWorkshop is focused on replicating all of the core functions present in Crash 4 to allow for the user to create their own custom content. LavaWorkshop will actively provide commits to the level side of LavaWorkspace but will also actively research on opening up opportunities for custom data tables, and features within the game.
